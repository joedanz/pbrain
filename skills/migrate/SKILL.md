# Migrate Skill

Universal migration from any wiki, note tool, or brain system into PBrain.

## Contract

- Source data is never modified or deleted; migration is additive only.
- Every migrated page is verified round-trip: written to pbrain, read back, spot-checked.
- Cross-references from the source system (wikilinks, block refs, tags) are converted to pbrain equivalents.
- Migration is tested on a sample (5-10 files) before bulk execution.
- Post-migration health check confirms page count, link integrity, and embedding coverage.

## Supported Sources

| Source | Format | Strategy |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Obsidian | Markdown + `[[wikilinks]]` | Direct import, convert wikilinks to pbrain links |
| Notion | Exported markdown or CSV | Parse Notion's export structure |
| Logseq | Markdown with `((block refs))` | Convert block refs to page links |
| Plain markdown | Any .md directory | Import directory into pbrain directly |
| CSV | Tabular data | Map columns to frontmatter fields |
| JSON | Structured data | Map keys to page fields |
| Roam | JSON export | Convert block structure to pages |

## Phases

1. **Assess the source.** What format? How many files? What structure?
2. **Plan the mapping.** How do source fields map to pbrain fields (type, title, tags, compiled_truth, timeline)?
3. **Test with a sample.** Import 5-10 files, verify by reading them back from pbrain and exporting.
4. **Bulk import.** Import the full directory into pbrain.
5. **Verify.** Check pbrain health and statistics, spot-check pages.
6. **Build links.** Extract cross-references from content and create typed links in pbrain.

## Obsidian Migration

1. Import the vault directory into pbrain (Obsidian vaults are markdown directories)
2. Convert `[[wikilinks]]` to pbrain links:
   - Read each page from pbrain
   - For each `[[Name]]` found, resolve to a slug and create a link in pbrain
   - `[[Name|alias]]` uses the alias for context

Obsidian-specific:
- Tags (`#tag`) become pbrain tags
- Frontmatter properties map to pbrain frontmatter
- Attachments (images, PDFs) are noted but handled separately via file storage

## Notion Migration

1. Export from Notion: Settings > Export > Markdown & CSV
2. Notion exports nested directories with UUIDs in filenames
3. Strip UUIDs from filenames for clean slugs
4. Map Notion's database properties to frontmatter
5. Import the cleaned directory into pbrain

## CSV Migration

For tabular data (e.g., CRM exports, contact lists):
1. For each row in the CSV, create a page with column values as frontmatter
2. Use a designated column as the slug (e.g., name)
3. Use another column as compiled_truth (e.g., notes)
4. Store each page in pbrain

## Verification

After any migration:
1. Check pbrain statistics to verify page count matches source
2. Check pbrain health for orphans and missing embeddings
3. Export pages from pbrain for round-trip verification
4. Spot-check 5-10 pages by reading them from pbrain
5. Test search: search pbrain for "someone you know is in the data"

## Anti-Patterns

- **Bulk import without sample test.** Never import the full dataset before verifying with 5-10 files. The cost of cleaning up hundreds of bad pages is enormous.
- **Destroying source data.** Migration is additive. Never modify, move, or delete the source files.
- **Ignoring cross-references.** Wikilinks, block refs, and tags from the source system must be converted to pbrain equivalents. Dropping them loses the knowledge graph.
- **Skipping verification.** A migration without post-import health check, page count comparison, and spot-check reads is incomplete.

## Output Format

```
MIGRATION REPORT -- [source] -> PBrain
=======================================

Source: [format] ([file count] files, [size])
Mapping: [field mapping summary]

Sample Test (N files):
- Imported: N/N
- Round-trip verified: N/N
- Cross-refs converted: N

Bulk Import:
- Total imported: N
- Skipped (duplicates/errors): N
- Links created: N
- Tags migrated: N

Verification:
- Page count match: [yes/no]
- Health check: [pass/fail]
- Search test: [query] -> [result count] hits
```

## Tools Used

- Store/update pages in pbrain (put_page)
- Read pages from pbrain (get_page)
- Link entities in pbrain (add_link)
- Tag pages in pbrain (add_tag)
- Get pbrain statistics (get_stats)
- Check pbrain health (get_health)
- Search pbrain (query)
